    \begin{itemize}
        \item Getting the software to run on the local SU cluster using (singularity) containers
              \footnote{We already have docker images available: \tiny\url{https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/theludwig/dnn_reco}}
        \item More complex models, less training
        \item Training with opening angle loss-function
        \item Understanding distribution of uncertainty prediction and pulls
        \item Start with MSE Loss-Function and move later to Gaussian Likelihood
        \item Finish by \emph{only} training uncertainty subnetwork
    \end{itemize}
